Story:

Wyri is a wyvern that has just hatched out of a golden egg and is new to the world. His siblings have not hatched (yet) so he wanders off alone.

Objectives:

* Find 7 bubbles
* Find 4 runes
* (optional) Find 30 dragon scales

Game mechanic & rules:

* When the player touches an obstacle/enemy, he dies instantly -> game reloads
* There are save spots that save everything upon touching
* There are Bubble blocks that dissapear after the player has a certain amount of bubbles collected

* Player can walk, jump, swim, die, shoot bubbles, jump on bubbles
* Bubbles trap enemies, which then can be touched from side or bottom to shoot them side- or upwards (cascading effect on other enemies)
* Bubbles acquire abilities upon gathering the 4 runes
	* Force ability: Allows bubbles to destroy blocks without having to toss enemies (player touches bubble from the side to shoot away or from above to shoot downwards)
	* Lightning ability: Between bubbles, there is lightning -> activate switches and kill enemies
	* Sun ability: Bubbles create sunlight and shine in the darkness (in the dark area)
	* Air ability: When player jumps into bubble from below, he gets trapped in his own bubble, flying up (can be cancelled by shooting)
	
Optional ending:
	* When collecting 30 dragon scales, player gets wings and can infinetly jump (= "fly")
	* -> Player can then reach a castle in the sky
	* -> hard area, extra boss, extra ending
