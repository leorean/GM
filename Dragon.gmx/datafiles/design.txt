Story:

Wyri is a wyvern that has just hatched out of a golden egg and is new to the world. His siblings have not hatched (yet) so he wanders off alone.
He stumbles magic bubbles which give him the ability to blow more and more bubbles and jump on it.

Objectives:

* Find 7 bubbles
* Find 4 runes
* (optional) Find 30 dragon scales

Game mechanic & rules:

* When the player touches an obstacle/enemy, he dies instantly -> game reloads
* There are save spots that save everything upon touching
* There are Bubble blocks that dissapear after the player has a certain amount of bubbles collected

* Player can walk, jump, swim, die, shoot bubbles, jump on bubbles
* Bubbles trap enemies, which then can be touched from side or bottom to shoot them side- or upwards (cascading effect on other enemies)
* Bubbles acquire abilities upon gathering the 4 runes
	* Fire ability: Allows bubbles to destroy blocks without having to toss enemies (player touches bubble from the side to shoot away or from above to shoot downwards)
	* Lightning ability: Between bubbles, there is lightning -> activate switches and kill enemies
	* Sun ability: Bubbles create sunlight and shine in the darkness (in the dark area)
	* Air ability: When player jumps into bubble from below, he gets trapped in his own bubble, flying up (can be cancelled by shooting)
	
Optional ending:
	* When collecting 30 dragon scales, player gets wings and can infinetly jump (= "fly")
	* -> Player can then reach a castle in the sky
	* -> hard area, extra boss, extra ending
