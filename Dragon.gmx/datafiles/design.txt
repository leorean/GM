~~~ Prologue ~~~

Once, there existed four kinds of dragons:

The earth wyverns, strong and steady. With their strength, they formed the caverns that traverse the lands.
The thunder wyverns controlled rain and lightning with their energy and brought life to regions of the world where none would be able to exist without them.

He finds a man hiding in his cave, telling him:

"I'm safe. The Wot'ak won't find me here. Those spooky demons with masks, you know." 

 Are you here to slay Raowa?

"Your destiny is to slay the great Raowa, a mighty 

//Having been warned of their future by a travelling stranger, the main character is suddenly forced to leave their home and family when they learn of a beast that steadily grows in power that that can only be stopped by one who was once dark, but is now light.
